This is the repo for my MATH470 Honours Research Project, supervised by Dr. Courtney Paquette and Dr. Alessandro Navarra. The topic for this research project is the application of various optimization algorithms to problems in mine planning.

When running code in the code repository, you must first install these
```bash
